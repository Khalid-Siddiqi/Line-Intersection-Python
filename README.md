# Line-Intersection-Python
I have used Python Tkinter Library To Show the GUI Versions of 3 Different Line Intersection Algorithms:
* Bently-Ottomann Method
* Slope and Intersect Method
* Parametric Method
# Bently-Ottomann Method:
## Introduction:
The algorithm was initially developed by Jon Bentley and Thomas Ottmann (1979).
## Time Complexity:
O((n + k)Â·log n)

# Slope and Intersection method:
  This method uses slope to find the intersection of lines.

# Parametric Method:
This method entails the use of vectors & scalars
