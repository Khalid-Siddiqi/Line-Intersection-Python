# Line-Intersection-Python
I have used Python Tkinter Library To Show the GUI Version's of 3 Different Line Intersection Algorithms:
* Bently-Ottomann Method
* Slope and Intersect Method
* Parametric Method
# Bently-Ottomann Method:
A research paper written by 

# Slope and Intersection method:
  This method uses slope to find intersection of lines.

# Parametric Method:
This method entails use of vectors & scalars
